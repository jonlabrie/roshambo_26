## [2026-08-15] migrate | Wiki created; migration from memory dir begins

Spec: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-15-project-wiki-design.md. 80 memory files to
be reconciled in, verified against git, then deleted from the memory dir.

## [2026-08-15] migrate | program/ shelf: board, item-4, parked-defects, backlog

From memory: roshambo-roadmap, world-throw-cycle-phase, teahouse-access-control-backlog,
spawn-at-teahouse-backlog, piece-b-startup-notes, roshambo-metagame-spec (deleted), plus
status fragments of friends-family-baseline, round-structure, play-hud, structure-builder,
apprunner-migration, fw11-switchback-deck, yamadoro (deleted by later tasks). Notable
reconciliations: access-control "NOT built" superseded by the 2026-07-19/20 ship; FW11
railings/chōchin "resume Task 1" superseded by d247a2e/5d1a21e; yamadoro "unplaced"
superseded by 0c8f362/17bbb08.

## [2026-08-15] migrate | world/ shelf: 15 as-built pages

From 28 memory files (arena-amplified, bell-engine, dock-uguisu, fw11-switchback-deck,
viewing-platform, canyon-redesign/clearing-terrain/upcanyon-watercourse/garden-phase1/
canyon-garden/canyon-village/river-path/yamadoro/water-margin/foliage-scatter,
forest-preserve-foliage, water-audio, fireworks, night-first-arena, round-structure,
play-hud-item2, structure-builder, deck-fall-prevention, flume-revisit,
happy-sad-sides, shoro-roof-wip, canyon-compass, friends-family-baseline fragments),
verified against git + a live Studio session (place "Roshambo", Edit). Superseded and
closed with no page of their own: the Phase-1 bowl tier garden (retired by the
2026-06-15 canyon pivot) and the shōrō-roof WIP (its blocker was resolved and the
roof shipped in `dae8f00`/`9503859` — recorded on arena-square). Notable live
reconciliations: the 14 legacy CanyonTeahouses are retired to
ServerStorage.RetiredLegacyTeahouses (CanyonWorld.Legacy is empty);
ServerStorage.FoliageZones holds 35 zone volumes (resolving the "22 of 32" worry);
StructurePrefabs now carries three authored sizes (teahouse-1story-s/m/l);
DayNightLockT is back at 0.19.
